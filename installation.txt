Steps:

  0. Create a new conda environment as a sandbox: `conda create -n name_of_env python=3 ipython`
  1. Clone both repo: xpdAcq and xpdSim. After clone, there should be two separate directories in your computer
  2. Navigate to each directory and run `python setup.py develop`
  3. After installtion, open an ipython section and run `from simsetup.xpdsim import *`
  4. Run `start_beamtime()` in ipython. Working directories will be created under `home/user/xpdUser`
  5. Navigate to xpdUser directory: `cd ~/xpdUser`
  6. Now you are ready to run simulations
