These instructions are for Simon
Steps:

Initial setup
  1. Create a new conda environment as a sandbox, e.g., : `conda create -n xpdsim python=3 ipython`
  2. Clone both repos: xpdAcq and xpdSim. After clone, there should be two separate directories in your computer. Make sure the Master branch is checked out.
  3. Navigate to the top directory of the xpdSim repository.
  4. Activate the `xpdsim` conda environment e.g., `source activate xpdsim` (linux) or `activate xpdsim` (windows)
  5. run `python setup.py develop`
  6. repeat for xpdAcq
  7. Add ophyd
      1. Install real ophyd: `git clone https://github.com/NSLS-II/ophyd.git`
      2. Navigate to `ophyd` repo, do `python setup.py develop`
      3. Install supporting packages `pip install pyepics prettytable`
      4. Now you can instanciate `pe1c` with `import xpdsim pe1c = xpdsim.simulator.Areadetector(any_number_you_want)`
  4. Copy and paste the `profile_xpdsim` directory from xpdSim to your `~/.ipython` directory

This should have installed all the components.
To run a simulation
  1. cd to a directory where you want to work.
  2. activate the simulation environment.
  3. Run `python -m initialize` at the command prompt. This creates the top level directories that are present on the xpd instrument computer
  4. start ipython: `ipython --profile=xpdsim`

  This block is wrapped inside loadsim. We can remove it after test
  #################################################################
  #1. type `flush_directories`.  This will delete everything in the
  #simulation tree
  #1. type `start_beamtime()`

  6. Now you are ready to run simulations: follow the directions on the xpdAcq
    document pages under the `XPD users` link.
