Steps:

Initial setup
  0. Create a new conda environment as a sandbox, e.g., : `conda create -n simulation python=3 ipython`
  1. Clone both repo: xpdAcq and xpdSim. After clone, there should be two separate directories in your computer. Make sure the Master branch is checked out.
  2. Navigate to the top directory of the xpdSim repository.
  1. Activate the `simulation` conda environment
  1. run `python setup.py develop`
  1. repeat for xpdAcq
  
This should have installed all the components.
To run a simulation
  1. cd to a directory where you want to work.
  1. activate the simulation environment
  3. open ipython session
  4. type `from simsetup.xpdsim import *`
  4. Run `start_beamtime()` in ipython. Working directories will be created under `home/user/xpdUser`
  5. Navigate to xpdUser directory: `cd ~/xpdUser`
  6. Now you are ready to run simulations
