These instructions are for Simon
Steps:

Initial setup
  0. Create a new conda environment as a sandbox, e.g., : `conda create -n xpdsim python=3 ipython`
  1. Clone both repos: xpdAcq and xpdSim. After clone, there should be two separate directories in your computer. Make sure the Master branch is checked out.
  2. Navigate to the top directory of the xpdSim repository.
  1. Activate the `xpdsim` conda environment
  1. run `python setup.py develop`
  1. repeat for xpdAcq

This should have installed all the components.
To run a simulation
  1. cd to a directory where you want to work.
  1. activate the simulation environment, e.g., `source activate
  xpdsim`
  4. Run `python -m initialize` at the command prompt. This creates
  the top level directories that are present on the
  xpd instrument computer
  5. start ipython: `ipython --profile=xpdsim`
  1. load simulation modules: `import loadsim`
  1. type `flush_directories`.  This will delete everything in the
  simulation tree
  1. type `start_beamtime`
  6. Now you are ready to run simulations: follow the directions on the xpdAcq
    document pages under the `XPD users` link.
